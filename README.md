My name is **Aakrit Sharma.**

I'm junior year **Computer Science** student at Chandigarh University. I'm **machine learning engineer** and data analyst. I'm also keenly interested in Public Healthcare Research and Analytics. 
Currently, I'm working on my 100 days of coding challenge, where I try to solve at least one Data-structures and Algorithms question.

Other than that, I also like to read, paint, or simply study about something new in my free time.
